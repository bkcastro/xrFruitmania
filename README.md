# xrFruitmania

xrFruitmania is a battleground where Brandon and Sylwester will explore how two WebXR enthusiasts can collaborate and build their own experience.

The idea is inspired by the app Fruit Merge. There are likely multiple implementations of this game, some of which are simple yet addictive. We believe it is an excellent starting point.
